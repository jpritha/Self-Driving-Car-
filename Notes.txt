-> this.#addKeyboardListeners(); in controls.js :
It is a method that checks whenever we press a key or release a key.
 *[ the reason that hashtag is put before the method is because it is a private method. 
    We cannot access this outside the control class.]


-> requestAnimationFrame(animate) in main.js in method animate(), calls the animate method again and again (like recursion) 
many times per second.
It gives the illusion of movement that we want.

-> ctx.restore() :
 If we do not restore the context, then in each frame of the animation we are going to translate and rotate and translate and rotate again ................infinite series of translation and rotation.

-> in main.js 
const road = new Road(canvas.width/2,canvas.width*0.9);       // x ( position) : half the canvas width , width : canvas.width   

->in main js 
ctx.translate(0,-car.y);   =>

    translate(x, y)  : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/translate

    The translate() method adds a translation transformation to the current matrix by moving the canvas and its origin x units horizontally and y units vertically on the grid.

    x :
    Distance to move in the horizontal direction. Positive values are to the right, and negative to the left.

    y :
    Distance to move in the vertical direction. Positive values are down, and negative are up.

-> in sensor .js


1> const offsets = touches.map(e=>e.offset);

    The array(touches). map() method basically goes through all the elements from this array : touches
    And for each element, it takes its offset. 
    Now this part returns a new array, in this case is offsets.

2> const minOffset = Math.min(...offsets);

    the minimum method doesnt accept array as an individual value. 
    So this ... operator is spreading the "offsets" array into many different individual values.

3> return touches.find(e => e.offset == minOffset);

    And finally return the touch from "touches" array that has the minimum offset using this find method here.
